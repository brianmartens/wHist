# wHist
Weather History web crawler for Wunderground.com. Just update the locations.csv file and add whatever latitude and longitude coordinates you need. After that just go run and watch the directory populate with your data. If you want to change the start time (default is Jan 1 2004) then just change the startTime variable in the createRoutine() function. Please be careful with this as one goroutine is created for each record in the locations.csv file.
