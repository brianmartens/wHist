# wHist
Weather History web crawler for Wunderground.com. Just update the GEO_LOCATIONS.csv file and add whatever latitude and longitude coordinates you need. After that just go run and watch the directory populate with your data. I'm currently updating this as Wunderground has moved to Angular. You guys can't win just to let you know until you stop giving me public access to your cgi-bin.
